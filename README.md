# Domino Dependency Mapping Visualization Tool

## Description
This application visualizes a service dependency map using the D3.js library. Users can upload a CSV file containing information about services and their dependencies, and view an interactive map that shows the relationships between services.

I started developing this small application during a train journey and it was completed during spare moments while playing with my son, who is passionate about Domino. He greatly appreciated the colorful graphics and the animation of the visualized services, which is why the chosen name is Domino Dependency Mapping Visualization Tool! :) 

## Features
- Upload CSV files containing service information.
- Display an interactive map of service dependencies.
- Search for specific services.
- View detailed information about services by clicking on nodes.
- Zoom and drag the map.
- Enriched fields derived from existing attributes (e.g., automatic Jira filter URLs).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/domino-service-dependency-map.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd domino-service-dependency-map
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Compile the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser (located in the `dist` folder).
2. Upload a CSV file using the upload button.
3. Use the search bar to find specific services.
4. Click on nodes to view detailed information about services.
5. Hide decommissioned services based on their Status field and Decommission Date values by clicking the dedicated CTA.
6. How to Search Using the Search Bar: You can refine your search using specific syntax. Below are examples and their meanings:
- key:"ServiceName1" → Searches for services with exactly the key-value pair key:"ServiceName1".
- "Value" → Searches for services that contain this value in any parameter.
- key:ServiceName1 → Searches for services that include a partial match for the key-value pair key:ServiceName1.
- key:ServiceName1,ServiceName2 → Performs a non-exact search for multiple services using comma-separated values.
- key:"ServiceName1","ServiceName2" → Performs an exact search for multiple services using comma-separated values.

## URL Parameters (Advanced Capabilities)
Solitaire supports optional URL parameters that extend or refine the visualization experience.
# stream
- stream=<name1,name2,...> — Isolate one or more Streams
  You can restrict the view to only the selected stream(s) by providing the stream parameter in the query string.
- Example:
  solitaire.html?stream=Order%20Management%20System
- or multiple streams:
  solitaire.html?stream=OMS,ERP,Replatforming

Effect: Only the selected streams are rendered on screen.
Themes, teams, and team members belonging to other streams are hidden.
The color legend dynamically adapts to show only the values present in the visible streams.

This is especially useful when sharing a focused view of a single functional area.

- advanced=true — Enable advanced editing tools
  By default, Solitaire runs in read‑only mode.
  Adding advanced=true unlocks additional capabilities:
  solitaire.html?advanced=true

Enabled features:

1. Upload CSV — Load a custom People Database export.
2. Change Scenario — Turn on drag‑and‑drop and resize mode for streams, themes, and teams.
3. Save Scenario — Store custom layout positions in the browser’s local storage.
4. Reset Scenario — Clear the saved layout and revert to the default arrangement.

This mode is intended for maintainers, editors, or users preparing custom visualizations.

## CSV Format
The CSV file should have the following format that are necessary for the dependency mapping visualization:
   ```bash
   Service Name,Description,Type,Depends on,Status,Decommission Date
   Service1,Service 1 description,Type1,Service2\nService3,Running,,
   Service2,Service 2 description,Type2,Service1,Stopped,03-16-2025,
   ```

Additionally, you can include other fields (columns) as desired. These fields will be displayed in the Service detail table section at the bottom, after clicking the single node service. 

# Solitaire: Org‑Chart & Team Explorer
## What it is
Solitaire is a companion application that renders the organizational chart and team/stream structure. It loads a CSV exported from the People Database on the dedicated Confluence page and provides a fast, filterable view of teams, streams, themes, and the services associated with each team. The People Database export typically includes individual‑level fields such as User, Role, Team link, Assigned team, Status, Company, Location, Room Link, In team since, Name, Company email, Photo, Stream.
For team‑level metadata like Theme, Team email, and role owners (e.g., Development Manager, Architect, Scrum Master, Product Manager, Delivery Manager), the Confluence Team Database includes those columns. [People Dat...ci Digital] [Team Datab...ci Digital]

Key Capabilities

Load a CSV exported from the People Database (Confluence).
Search and filter by:

- Team name
- Stream name
- Theme
- Services associated with teams


Click a team tile to see associated services and team metadata.
Navigate between team and stream views quickly.

## Usage (Solitaire)

Open solitaire.html (same bundle hosts both apps).
Click Upload CSV and select the People Database export (or a pre‑joined Team + People export).
Use the search bar to filter by team, stream, theme, or service.
Click a team tile to see services associated to that team (clickable list).


## CSV Format (Solitaire)

Each row is a person exported from the People Database (Confluence). Solitaire will group people by Assigned team to build team tiles; you can still filter by Stream, and you may add a Services column to the exported rows (or provide a separate mapping file) to enable service‑level filters. Typical People Database columns include: User, Role, Team link, Assigned team, Status, Company, Location, Room Link, In team since, Name, Company email, Photo, Stream. [People Dat...ci Digital]
Minimum required columns

Assigned team — Team name used for grouping.
Stream — Stream label (used for filtering).
Name — Person’s full name.

Recommended columns

Role, Company email, Team link, Status, Location, In team since — Improve richness of the team tiles and detail popovers. [People Dat...ci Digital]
Services — Optional; multi‑value list of services this person (or their team) is associated with. If present, Solitaire bubbles these up to the team.

```

## How Solitaire’s search works

Team name / Stream / Theme: exact or partial matches across the corresponding columns (Option A) or the aggregated values (Option B).
Services: matches any service string listed in the Services field. If aligned with Domino’s Service Name, results will be consistent across the two apps.

## Interoperability with Domino
To enable cross‑navigation between Solitaire and Domino:

Keep Solitaire → Services values identical to Domino → Service Name.
Use the same delimiter convention (\n inside quoted cells) for multi‑value fields to simplify parsing in both apps.

## Database Structure & Relationships (UML)
This section provides an Entity-Relationship (ER) UML diagram describing the logical connections between the main data sources used by Domino and Solitaire.
The diagram is based on the exported CSVs from Confluence:

- Streams Database: Macro-areas (streams) grouping product and business domains.
- Product Themes: Product or business themes, each belonging to a stream.
- Team Database: Teams, their members, and their association to themes and streams.
- People Database: Individual people, their roles, teams, and assignments.
- Service Catalog: Digital services, their dependencies, responsible teams, and associated themes.

The UML below shows how these entities relate and lists all available attributes for Person and Service as found in the CSVs.
This model helps developers, analysts, and maintainers understand how to join, filter, and extend the data for both visualization and reporting.
If I'll decide to move to a proper database, this would probably be the scheme I would follow. 

The underscore ('_') used on the field names is in the following uml just for visualization purposes and it is currently not considered by the current implementation of Solitaire and Domino.
